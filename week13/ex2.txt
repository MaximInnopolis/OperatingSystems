Deadlock recovery:
 • This method does not limit resources access or restrict process action
 • Requested resources are granted to processes whenever possible
 • It never delays the process initiation and facilitates online handling
 • However inherent pre-emption losses which is disadvantage

Deadlock avoidance:
 • This method is only possible when the system has the ability to decide whether it is safe to provide a resource, and only make allocations when it is safe to do so.
 • This requires the system to know the resources that the threads will request.

Deadlock prevention:
 • Instead of the process directly accessing the printer they output their requests in the spooling directory; these requests are queued and processed one by one by the printing daemon
 • Does not allow process taking resources before they release previously taken
 • Allow preemption, resources can be virtualized, again the example of spooling
 • Allow taking the resources only in a certain order, e.g. by numbering it from 1 to N and prohibiting acquiring a resource with a number lesser than the current resource in use.
