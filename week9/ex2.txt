For the given input data with increasing size hit/miss ration increases.

The hit/miss ratio would be n, where:
k k k k k ... k repeated n+1 times
This happens because the same page we reference n+1 times is not already in memory

In another way hit/miss ration would be 0, where:
1 2 3 4 5 ... n
This happens because we reference different page. No hits and n misses in case that can be seen above
