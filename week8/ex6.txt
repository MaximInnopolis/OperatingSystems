A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How
many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table?

8 KB = 2^13 bytes,
We need 13 bits to represent an address inside a page.
Thus, for referencing the page we are left with 16 - 13 = 3 bits. This is 8 pages at most.

Answer: 8 entries.
